This was initially a challenge posed by an interviewer, and now serves as an experimental app for learning CSS styling and JS for responsiveness.

## Planned features

1. Ability to send, search, and delete messages and whole conversations.
2. Display/project each conversation in index.html instead of redirecting to a specific page e.g. page2.html
3. Add containers for each conversation (refer to feature #2).
